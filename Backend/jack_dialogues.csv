Speaker,Dialogue
JACK,"Sorry, Mate. Jack reaches down and tugs hard, pulls, tugs -- SNAP! He holds a SKELETON LEG, pulled out at the hip. JACK  Mind if we take a little side trip? Didn't think so. * Using this makeshift oar, Jack turns the coffin, rows toward the Pearl ... 6"
JACK,"Complications arose, ensued, were overcome."
JACK,Shiny.
JACK,Is that how you're all feeling? That I'm not serving your interests as Captain? An awkward silence. Finally ...
JACK,What did the bird say?
JACK,"Keeps my aim sharp. Marty grabs the cloth before it blows away. The crew examines it. Marty turns it, revealing that it is a rough drawing of --"
JACK,"Better. (takes the cloth, displays it) It's a drawing of a key. Jack waits. The crew is not as impressed as Jack seems to expect. Jack can't believe they aren't more excited. JACK  Gentlemen, what do keys do?"
JACK,"No. If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it unlocks, so what purpose would be served in finding whatever needs be unlocked without first having found the key that unlocks it? Honestly. Ninny."
JACK,"What good is a key if we have nothing for the key to unlock? Please, try and keep up! The crew considers this ... considers ... then shrug, nod, sure, that makes sense. They go with it."
JACK,Aye! A heading!
JACK,"I'll plot our course later.  Snap to and make sail! You know how it works! He strides toward his cabin. The crew turns to their tasks, but not happily."
JACK,Why is the rum always gone? He stands up -- and staggers a bit . JACK  Right. That's why. He makes his way carefully to the door -- 16
JACK, Steady as she goes ... 17
JACK,That's what I thought. Jack continues on -- 18
JACK,Bootstrap? Bill Turner?
JACK,Is this a dream?
JACK,"I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum. Bootstrap grins. Raises an arm, offering Jack -- a bottle of rum. Jack smiles. It costs a bit of effort to pull it loose, since Bootstrap's hand is also encrusted with barnacles. Jack sniff it. Rum. He wipes the mouth of the bottle."
JACK,Bouillabaisse ...  I had some help retrieving the Pearl. Your son. Bootstrap is taken aback.
JACK,Given a liberal definition of the word 'pirate.' He's got an unhealthy streak of honest to him.
JACK,And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?
JACK,"Ah, it's you, then. He shanghaied you into service, then."
JACK,That is the kind of thinking bound to catch his attention.
JACK,Funny what a man'll do to forestall his final judgment.
JACK,Technically --
JACK,"The Flying Dutchman already has a captain, so there's no need for me. Bootstrap sighs, nods. The answer he expected."
JACK,Any idea on when Jones will release said terrible beastie?
JACK,"On deck! All hands!  Lift the skin up, make fast the bundt gasket! Keep your loof!  Have care of the lee hatch! Scurry! Movement, I want movement! The crew scrambles to obey -- 20"
JACK,"Haul those sheets! Haul 'em!  Run, mates, run, as if the devil himself and itself is on us! Gibbs searches, finds Jack hiding behind the mast."
JACK,Land!
JACK,"I didn't say port, I said land! Any land! The SKELETAL MONKEY chooses that moment to drop onto Jack's shoulder and scream. The Monkey does a spinning leg kick aimed at Jack's hat -- and the hat flies off, tumbles overboard. The Monkey leaps into the rigging, laughs. Revenge is sweet."
JACK,"No! Leave it. Slow head turn. Gibbs can't believe what he's heard. Neither can the Monkey. The rest of the Crew can't believe it, either."
JACK,Sh!
JACK,"Nothing. He gives Gibbs a little ""shoo, back to work"" gesture. Gibbs stares at Jack as Jack stares out at the water --"
JACK,"Save me. Will frowns -- Jack is the Chief, what's going on? But there is real desperation in Jack's eyes. Will is pulled away -- 46"
JACK,"I notice women here, but very few children -- why is that? Are the little ones the most tasty? No answer. Jack eyes an EMPTY SPIT with concern. Suddenly: JACK   Not big enough! Heads turn. Jack strides toward the empty spit. Points at the wood pile beneath it. JACK  Not big enough!  I am the Chief! More wood! I need more wood! Big fire! "
JACK,"Rope. Rope. Long rope. Or a chain. No. Preferably rope -- Jack pauses -- lifts up a small box of SPICES with the East India Trading Company insignia. A sound draws his attention -- Warrior is there. Spear raised, ready to kill him. JACK  Not running away, no ... Jack shifts into Cannibal language, saying the same with clicks and grunts. He pours out spice, rubs it on his body. JACK  See? 52"
JACK,Nice job. 53
JACK,"After them! Don’t let them get away! The Warrior nods - and everyone takes off -- The Runner with the torch hesitates, torn ... light the fire or run? He drops the torch, follows the others -- Jack’s eyes go wide as the torch rolls toward the wood beneath him. He twists on the spit, tries to blow the flame out ... and the extra air causes the wood to ignite with a FWOOMP! 56 IN THE CHASM, Will's cage reaches the top first -- 56 In the other cage, Leach grabs onto a vine -- that turns out to be a SNAKE. The men lose their grip, the cage falls -- -- the vine holding it SNAPS, and the cage drops away, into the abyss. Will’s cage rolls over the top and pirates scream. The vine holding it pulls out from the ground -- Cannibals appear -- The pirates STAND UP, their feet sticking out of the bottom of the cage -- and start to run."
JACK,"Good doggy! -- on his way to the Black Pearl. Catches a rope, scrambles on board. 63 ON THE BEACH, the Cannibals reach the shore, and stop ... they 63 yell, but the tone is more confused than angry -- why are you going? Why are you leaving us? 64 ANGLE - THE BLACK PEARL, as it pulls away from the island. 64 65 ON THE BEACH, the Cannibals shout and the Prison Dog BARKS. The 65 Cannibals gradually grow SILENT, and then it's only the dog"
JACK,"Yes to the first and yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible."
JACK,"I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Mr. Gibbs.  Where's that monkey?  I want to shoot something. From ABOVE comes a frightened SCREECH, and then RAGETTI'S EYE falls to the deck, rolls away. Jack turns -- come face-to-face with Will."
JACK,Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on her?  Maybe just lock her up somewhere?
JACK,There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes. He tried to move past -- Will pulls his sword.
JACK,"So.  You get the Compass, you rescue your bonny lass -- again.  Where's my profit?"
JACK,Accepting those things is what you want me to do for you.  Agreed.  But what will you do for me? Will works this through -- gives up.
JACK,"Gibbs!  We have a need to go up the river. Gibbs, at the wheel, looks scared, reluctant."
JACK,"No, a resolute and unyielding need. Gibbs curses under his breath.  Gibbs spins the wheel."
JACK,"William.  I will trade to you the Compass, if you will help me find -- this. Jack pulls out the small cloth with the imprint of the key."
JACK,You want me to find this.  To save Elizabeth. Will takes the cloth.
JACK,How much do you know about Davy Jones?
JACK, Yep -- it's going to save Elizabeth. 69
JACK,"No worries, mates.  I'll handle this. Tia Dalma and I go way back.  Thick as thieves.  Nigh inseparable, we were...have been ... before."
JACK,It's me front I'm worried about. Jack starts to climb.  Gibbs follows --
JACK,There will be no knowing here. We came here for help. He ushers Tia Dalma back toward the table. JACK   I thought I knew you.
JACK,"It's not so much for me, as for William, so he can earn a favor from me."
JACK,"I brought payment! Jack lifts the object from the Pintel, unveils it -- a cage, and trapped inside, the Screeching MONKEY.  Jack shoots it. The Monkey takes the bullet, glares at Jack. JACK  See?  Perhaps you can give it the crocodile treatment? Tia Dalma opens the cage.  The Monkey runs free."
JACK,No. Tia Dalma laughs.
JACK,A woman.
JACK,That was a roundabout way to get to the answer.
JACK,"No, I didn't. I didn't know where the key was -- Jack stands up, resolved and ready to go. JACK  But now we do, so all that is left is to slip aboard the Flying Dutchman, take the key, and then you can go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass. Will scowls, thinking of the task ahead. Jack starts off --"
JACK,"My eyesight is as good as ever, just so you know. Gibbs leans in, sees the Spot -- and starts brushing away evil, the way Jack did, turns three times widdershins.  Pintel and Ragetti quickly mimic Gibbs, just in case. Tia Dalma regards the Black Spot with respect.  She crosses to a stairway, climbs.  Opens a carved door at the top -- The SOUND OF THE OCEAN whispers down. Gibbs glances at Jack -- that's weird, right? Jack nods, yeah, it's weird. Ragetti peeks up the stairs ... the room above is dark, he sees only a PAIR OF EMPTY BOOTS at the door, the Monkey staring at them. Tia Dalma closes the door. The sound of the sea is gone. 46."
JACK,Dirt.  This is a jar of dirt
JACK,Is the jar of dirt going to help?
JACK,No!
JACK,Neither do you.  Don't underestimate her. Gibbs is pointedly silent. Jack looks at him to say something.
JACK, What's your plan?
JACK,If there are crewmen?
JACK,"I like it. Simple and easy to remember. AT THE RAIL, Will glances at the cloth and the imprint of the key, stashes it in his pocket."
JACK,"Yes. If you do get captured, just say, ""Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt."" It might save your life."
JACK, Douse the lamps. 78
JACK,Technically I was only captain for two years -- then I was viciously mutinied upon.
JACK,"Not that I recall, why do you ask?  You have my payment. One soul, to serve on your ship. He is already over there. Jones face twists -- a combination of anger and incredulity."
JACK,"There is precedent regarding servitude, according to the code of the Brethen --"
JACK,"Ah, so we've established the proposal is sound in principle. Now we're just haggling over price. 53."
JACK,Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth? Davy Jones rubs his octopus beard ... and smiles.
JACK,"You're a diamond, mate.  Send me back the boy, I'll get started, right off. Jones is not inclined to do Jack any favors."
JACK,"What? Have you met Will Turner? He's noble and heroic, a terrific soprano ... he's worth at least four. Jones is unmoved. JACK  And ... did I mention he is in love?"
JACK,Due to be married. To a lovely young lady. You hate that malarky. Jones shoots Jack a keen look.
JACK,Not remotely ... but I could be if it helps make the deal. 54.
JACK,Yep.
JACK,I'm good with it. Shall we seal it in blood? I mean ink? Jones' face darkens.
JACK,"Agreed. They shake hands. JACK  I'd embrace you but I fear it might stick. Jack lifts his hand to eye-level ... and the BLACK SPOT FADES. He looks past his hand -- Jones is gone. Jack looks around -- Jones' men are gone. Jack moves to the railing. He stares out at the Flying Dutchman, as it is already sailing off, into a distant storm. JACK  Gibbs, what is the worth of a man's soul?"
JACK,Three days. 86
JACK,How are we doing?
JACK,I make no promises.
JACK,You're hired.
JACK,Time to go.
JACK,"Come to join my crew, lad? Well enough, welcome aboard."
JACK,"I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea."
JACK,"Elizabeth?  Hide the rum.  You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all.  It should be a dress, or nothing.  Come aboard.  I happen to have no dress in my cabin."
JACK,"Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this ... Elizabeth braces herself. JACK  ... But through an unfortunate and entirely unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me ... poor Will was press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew."
JACK,Bang on.  You look bloody awful. What are you doing here?
JACK,You smell funny.
JACK,Are you certain?  Is that what you really want ... most? Elizabeth is not certain what he's getting at.
JACK,I'd think you'd want to find a way to save Will ... most.
JACK,Well ... there is a chest.
JACK,A chest of of unknown size and origin.
JACK,And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones do whatever it is he ... or she ... wants.  Including saving our brave William from his grim fate.
JACK,With this. He displays the Compass. JACK  This Compass is unique.
JACK,"True enough, this Compass does not point North."
JACK,It points to the thing you want most in this world.
JACK,"Every word, luv. She decides that he is. He puts the compass in her hands. JACK  What you want most in the world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?"
JACK,"By finding the chest of Davy Jones. He opens the Compass and steps back quickly, then leans back in to look at, careful not to touch it or Elizabeth. The needle swings, then holds steady.  Jack grins. JACK  Mr. Gibbs!  We have our heading!"
JACK,"Welcome aboard!  Miss Swann? She steps up the ramp.  Norrington is handed a goat, follows."
JACK,"A bit of manual labor is good for you, James --  It builds character. Jack grins, and Norrington suppresses the urge to strangle him. Elizabeth furtively crouches under the stairs. She sets down a stolen bottle of ink and a quill pen.  Unfolds the Letters of Marque, smooths them out. Glances around. She dips the pen into the ink, ready to fill in a name -- Suddenly the Letters are snatched away."
JACK,"These Letters of Marque are supposed to go to me, are they not? Jack glances at the bottom -- and pauses, stunned. JACK  There's a signature."
JACK,Beckett.
JACK,And never said a word of it.
JACK, A discomfiting notion.
JACK,(to Elizabeth re: the Letters) May I inquire as to how you came by these?
JACK,Friendly?
JACK,Funny thing. Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. But you're the one standing here with the prize. Elizabeth is a bit taken aback by that. JACK  Full pardon ... commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company ... Norrington looks up at that ... continues scrubbing.
JACK,Persuade me.
JACK,"As I said -- persuade me. Jack grins. Elizabeth stares, considering for moment slapping him or  ... something ... but finally turns and walks away, flushed ... then a slight smile comes crosses her face."
JACK,"Elizabeth, are you well? Everything shipshape and Bristol fashion? She backs away from his breath. Jack is undaunted. JACK  My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me you are troubled."
JACK,"I like marriage! It's like a wager on who will fall out of love first. Elizabeth moves away from him. He pursues. JACK  You know, I am Captain of a ship.  I could perform a marriage right here, right on this deck, right now."
JACK,"Why not? Admit it ... we are so much alike, you and I. I and you."
JACK,"Trifles. You will come over to my side, in time. I know."
JACK,"One word, luv. Curiosity.  You long for freedom. To do what you want because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it’s like. Someday ... you won’t be able to resist."
JACK,My Compass works just fine.
JACK,I love those moments! I like to wave as they pass by! 84.
JACK,All evidence to the contrary.
JACK,"Do tell, dear. Elizabeth looks at him knowingly. Savors every word, knowing he wants her, and playing into it."
JACK,I want to know what it tastes like.
JACK,I want my jar. 120
JACK,Guard the boat. Mind the tide. He moves off --
JACK,No fraternizing with the help love. Elizabeth starts walking.
JACK,Yes it does. You're sitting on it.
JACK,"Move. Jack unceremoniously shoves Elizabeth aside, makes an ""X"" in the sand with his toe. Looks at Norrington expectantly. Norrington gets the hint, starts digging."
JACK,"I do that a lot, and yet people are still surprised."
JACK,How did you get here?
JACK,"Not so easy, is it?"
JACK,You do?
JACK,What?
JACK,You're welcome. Elizabeth is dismayed. To Jack:
JACK,"Yes. Time and tide, love -- what are you doing? Will has kneeled at the chest, key in hand, his father's knife in the other."
JACK,"I can't let you do that, William. If Jones is dead, then who's to call his beastie off the hunt? Now, if you please -- the key. Will slaps Jack's sword away, jumps back -- another RING as he draws Elizabeth's sword. Faces off against Jack."
JACK,I knew you'd warm up to me eventually. The point of Norrington's sword moves to Jack.
JACK,Ah. The dark side of ambition.
JACK,"Will, we can't let him get the chest. You can trust me on this ...  You can mistrust me less than you can mistrust him. Will really takes a look at Norrington for the first time."
JACK,"Pot. Kettle. Black. They leap back and the fight is on. Will is pushed aside for a moment, long enough to say to Elizabeth:"
JACK,"Hah-hah! Jack races away. Norrington trips Will, kicks his sword away."
JACK,"Let's examine that claim for a moment, shall we, former Commodore.  Who was the man who, at the moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars and a beautiful dolly belle bound for the bridal, saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved for himself? (Jack shoots his eyes toward Will) I was nothing more than an almost innocent bystander to the aforementioned events...so whose fault is it really that you ended up as a rum-pot deck hand who takes orders from pirates."
JACK,"Still rooting for you, mate! On the roof the fight continues."
JACK,Ohh... 135
JACK,"Leave him lie, unless you're going to use him to hit things! All of Jones men are gathered, ready to attack. Too many to fight. Elizabeth and Norrington stand side by side."
JACK,I say we respect his final wish.
JACK,Fell behind.
JACK,"Hallo! Fish-head! Lose something? Hah-hah! Yoo-hoo, over here! Have a look-see! 147"
JACK,"Ahoy ink breath! Squid face! Looking for this? Did you come to negotiate? Hah! Suddenly Jack freezes when he sees -- cannon ports on the Flying Dutchman are opening. Jack fumbles at the jar lid -- JACK  Hold on, now, um, wait, just a second now ... Elizabeth reacts --"
JACK,"Why fight, when you can negotiate?  All one needs is the proper leverage -- Suddenly the Black Pearl LURCHES. Sailors fall forward. The jar is knocked free, tumbles to the deck -- -- the jar SHATTERS. Jack looks -- sand all over the deck."
JACK,"Hello? Where's the heart? The ship groans, shudders ... is PULLED TO A STOP."
JACK,* Abandon ship! Into the longboat! *
JACK,* It's just a ship. * It's a small moment -- they both know they're saying good- bye to the Pearl. *
JACK,* We're not free yet. * She moves toward him. *
JACK,"Pirate. The word stings Elizabeth. At the SHOUTS from the others, she backs away, races across the deck, down onto the long boat -- 167"
JACK,"Huh. Not bad, really. And then Jack notices something -- his hat! Caught on some of the pinkish cilia surrounding the mouth.  Jack leaps for it, snags it, puts it on. Straightens the hat ... he feels a little better now.  Looks up, and faces his doom -- JACK  Hello, beastie. He pulls his sword, and charges forward -- 169"
JACK,"Boatswain! Haul the halyard, slacken braces! PAN UP TO -- surprise! -- JACK SPARROW, a second one, in the rigging. Jack waves and calls down: JACK   Aye, Captain! Slacken braces, men, make all! How does she lie? ON DECK, a sailor turns: JACK SPARROW again."
JACK,"No wind. Nearby are several SMOOTH ROUND STONES. Jack picks one up and FLINGS it, skipping it across the sand. Jack sits down. Looks over. Weirdly, the stone comes rolling back. The stone rocks back and forth, an egg hatching. Cracks appear. The stone transform into a crab. The Crab turns toward Jack. Clicks, like it's laughing. JACK  Perfect. What would my torment be without unusual crabs here to mock me. Jack grabs a handful of sand and flings it. The crab flinches back. Jack collapses. The crab scuttles forward, looks at Jack. Scuttles sideways, looks at the ship. The crab moves away to the pile of stones. Jack sits with his head lowered to his knees, alone in the dunes of the vast desert."
JACK,Interesting. 559
JACK,*  * Mister Gibbs. * Gibbs snaps to attention. *
JACK,* I thought so.  I expect you can account for your actions? * GIBBS   *  * Sir? *
JACK,* There has been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline upon my vessel!  Why?  Why is that? *
JACK,* I know that.  I know where I am and don't think I don't. *
JACK,* Ah ... Hector.  It's been too long. *
JACK,"* I did not. * ) * Tia Dalma, out and about! You add an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium. *"
JACK,"* Ah, William. Tell me, have you come because you need my help to save a certain distressing damsel? I mean, damsel in distress? *  * Either one. *"
JACK,"* Then you wouldn't be here, so you can't be here, Q.E.D, you're not really here. *"
JACK,* The Locker you say. *
JACK,* Have you now?  That's a good one. Very kind of you. * 
JACK,* Can't spot it. Must be a tiny little thing hiding somewhere behind the Pearl. * Barbossa and Jack are about to go at it -- Will steps between. *
JACK,"I leave you folk alone for just a minute, and look what happens."
JACK,Why should I sail with any of you? Four of you have tried to kill me in the past.  One of you succeeded. Will is startled. Jack notices.  (It's news to all of them of course.)
JACK,"That's fair. All right, you're in.  I don't need you.  Gibbs, you get another chance. Marty. Cotton, all right. And Cotton's Parrot, I'm a little iffy, but all right, you're a team -- * Jack comes to Tai Huang. JACK  And you are?"
JACK,Where do your allegiances lie?
JACK,I have a ship.
JACK,"* Weigh anchor!  All hands! Stand by to make way! * He pulls out his Compass. Glances down:  the needle holds steady.  Jack smiles, moves his hand -- the needle doesn't move.  No matter how he fiddles, the needle is frozen in place * BARBOSSA   * Ja-ack. Jack turns. Barbossa holds up the ancient charts."
JACK,Trim that sail! Slack windward brace and sheet! Haul that pennant line!
JACK,The Captain gives orders on a ship.
JACK,"My ship, that makes me Captain."
JACK,"What, this? Just ventilating. Clear out the stench of the previous owner, you know. Thinking of putting in French doors, actually. Feel the cross breeze? Gibbs sticks his head in."
JACK,Two degrees starboard --
JACK,Elizabeth. We're not back yet. He looks her in the eye. Elizabeth stares at him -- and realization dawns. Her next cry is one of anguish:
JACK,"Up is down. That's maddeningly unhelpful. Why are these things never clear? 571 CLOSE ON: Jack's hair, a JUNGLE of GIANT DREADLOCKS, as a small 571 Jack-on-Jack's-shoulder pushes through."
JACK,What? A second small Jack is on Jack's right shoulder.
JACK,Come again?
JACK,That's even more than less than unhelpful.
JACK,I love the sea.
JACK,I prefer rum.  Rum's good.
JACK,Once every ten years.
JACK,"Even longer, given the deficit of rum."
JACK,Oooh I like that.
JACK,Not sun-set.  Sun-down.  And rise ... up! He stands. Points. JACK  Over there! What's that? I don't know! What do you think?
JACK,"There, it moved! Suddenly. It's very fast. Everyone follows -- what is he up to? The ship tilts that way some; the eyeball rolls. Elizabeth can't help but notice the activity. Jack suddenly seems to see something on back the port side -- JACK  Thar! Over thar! He runs to port. Elizabeth follows everyone else to the rail. The ship rocks back."
JACK,"It's not here! He runs across again, everyone follows, and the ship tilts more. Barbossa approaches the map -- sees UP IS DOWN, the upside down ship, the sunset. Picks up the rolling eye. A glare at Ragetti -- and Barbossa hands back the eye, goes back to studying the chart."
JACK,"And now up, is down! The Black Pearl rocks completely over into the water. Waves fill the sails and cause the ship to continue to roll -- 575"
JACK,"I is arguing the point. If there's pirates a-gathering, I'm a-pointing my ship the other a-way."
JACK,Then I’ll be the last pirate. At least then there will be only one of me.
JACK,"Still working on it. But I'm not going back to the Locker, Barbossa. Count on that."
JACK,You lead the shore party. I'll stay with the ship.
JACK,"An unholy one. Jack opens his own telescope, until it is long as Barbossa's ... then opens it further, until it is much longer. It droops at the end. Barbossa looks at him. He smiles. Barbossa snaps his telescope closed. 580"
JACK,"Sometimes things come back. We're living proof, mate."
JACK,"It's still the same size. There's just less in it.  Summoning the Brethren Court, is it?"
JACK,"That's sad commentary, in and of itself. 581"
JACK, He's the Captain. 583
JACK,So now we can call it square.
JACK,Captain Turner?
JACK,"It's always the quiet ones. Elizabeth, unchained now, eyes Will warily."
JACK,But you've no acrimony toward mutineers?
JACK,"He needs the Pearl --  -- and you felt guilty --  -- and you and your Brethren Court ... Didn't anyone come to save me just because they missed me? Gibbs, Marty and Cotton raise their hands -- Pintel and Ragetti see, and follow their lead."
JACK,I'm not certain I can survive any more visits from old friends.
JACK,Thank you for that memory.
JACK,"People aren't cargo, mate."
JACK,What is not?
JACK,"By my reckoning, that account's been settled."
JACK,Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream. That's how I get by. Beckett's control lapses momentarily; he says something he's wanted to say for a long time.
JACK,"And you spared me any possibility of ending up as anything other than what I am. And for that, I thank you. He picks up a couple of the model ships from the table, pretends to ""sail"" them. JACK  Will someone be in soon to draw you a bath? Beckett takes them from Jack, puts them back in their places."
JACK,"If you're offering me a seat on the board, I am neither depraved enough nor drunk enough to accept. Beckett hands one of the GLASSES of sherry to Jack, who's a bit surprised. Beckett toasts him."
JACK,"Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt. In exchange for fair compensation? Square my debt with Jones, guarantee my freedom?"
JACK,"Were I in a divulgatory mood, what might I divulge?"
JACK,I think I'd prefer to maintain my monopoly on those answers. It's just good business.
JACK,"I've been. Once you've taken in the view, there's not much else to it. "
JACK,With a frilly linen napkin and a spicy banana on the side. 585
JACK,"You can keep Barbossa. The belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye, both. And Turner. Especially Turner. If he were twins, you could have all three of 'em. Beckett notes that, suspicion behind his eyes."
JACK,What interest is she to you?
JACK,"Points to the thing you want most. And that's not the Brethren Court, is it?"
JACK,"Me.  Dead. He gestures to the compass: try it. Beckett opens the compass. From his reaction, it points to Jack. Jack scuttles sideways. From Beckett's reaction, the needle follows him."
JACK,"With me killed, then you'll arrive at the Cove, find it's a stronghold, nigh impregnable, able to withstand blockade for years, and you'll be wishing, oh, if only there was someone who you had not killed inside to ensure that the pirates come outside."
JACK,"You may kill me, but you may never insult me. Who am I?  I'm Captain Jack Sparrow, mate. Do we have an accord? He nods, indicating his still-extended hand. Beckett hesitates -- THE SHIP IS ROCKED BY CANNON FIRE. Beckett falls forward. Jack grabs his hand, shakes it -- JACK  Done! -- scoops up his effects and heads for the door 587"
JACK,"Oh thank goodness. Because if I am in fact not living some wretched fever dream, I doubt this will work. Jack lights the cannon -- Beckett dives out of the way as it FIRES -- the ball hits the mast behind him, cracking it. The RECOIL shoves the cannon violently back; it SMASHES through the rail -- and PLUMMETS -- Jack hangs on as the rope pulls him upwards and out, flying across --"
JACK,"Tell me you didn't miss me. Barbossa turns away in disgust. Jack hops down, comes face- to-face with Will. JACK  Send this piss-yellow traitor to the brig. Will is dragged away -- 591 ON THE ENDEAVOUR, OFFICER GROVES steps up to Beckett. 591"
JACK,"That's odd, isn't it? He drops down to the forecastle, looks over Will's handiwork. JACK  But not so odd as this. You came up with this all on your lonesome?"
JACK,And this is what you arrived at? Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove so as to win his trust and accomplish your own ends? It's like you don't know me at all.
JACK,And how does your dearly beloved feel about your plan? Will returns to his work without answering. JACK  Ah. You've not seen fit to trust her with it.
JACK,"If you choose to lock your heart away, you will lose her for certain. But if I might offer an exceedingly simple solution: Don't save your father."
JACK,"""Can't"" is a matter of fact. "
JACK,"Death has a way of reshuffling one's priorities. I slip aboard the Dutchman, I find the heart and stab the beating thing. Your father goes free from his debt, and you are free to be with your charming murderess."
JACK,"No, I am free forever. Free to sail the seas, beyond the edges of he map, free from death itself. Crew aboard the Dutchman is one thing, but Captain? Sign me up."
JACK,I don't have the face for tentacles. 
JACK,Think like me. It'll come to you. Will puzzles -- then realizes exactly what Jack is going to do just a half-a-second too late -- and Jack SHOVES HIM OVER
JACK," Give my regards to Davy Jones! He smile broadly, waves, disappears."
JACK,"You know, for all that pirates are clever clogs capable of the most underhanded and duplicitous thinking ... we are an unimaginative lot when it comes to naming things."
JACK,"Step out, Mr. Cotton.  There's some dangerous cross tides ahead that will prove a trick to navigate."
JACK,If you knew how many died making it deep enough -- you'd believe. They sail toward a distant light. The ship passes outside -- 611
JACK,And I owe all of them money. 612
JACK,"We're still short one Pirate Lord. I'm content to wait until Sao Feng joins us. ELIZABETH  Sao Feng is dead. Elizabeth stands in the doorway, with Huang behind her. She starts in; Huang touches her shoulder, gestures to the globe. ELIZABETH  Before he died, he named me captain of the Empress, and passed his lordship onto me."
JACK,Captain? Captain? They're just giving the title away now. Sumbhajee makes a small gesture to Ashay.
JACK,"Hers, I'll wager."
JACK, Not among us.
JACK,Shoot him and then cut out his tongue! And then shoot his tongue. And trim that scraggly beard.
JACK,This is politics.
JACK,Or at least grant 'em to the one of us who summoned the rest of us and connived all of us to set her free. Barbossa shoots him a glare. The other pirates eye Barbossa suspiciously. JACK  It's not impossible. Is it so improbable?
JACK,"Cuttlefish. Nasty little buggers. Pen 'em up together, and they'll devour each other without a second thought. So, yes, we could hole up here, well-provisioned and well-armed, and half of us will be dead within the month, and half of the other half dead the month after that. The pirate lords can't argue with that. JACK  Or, we can release Calypso, and we can pray she'll be in a merciful mood.  But can we pretend that she is anything other than a woman scorned, like which fury hell hath no? No, we cannot. Res ipso loquitur, tabula in naufragi, we are left with only one option. I agree with --  Captain Swann: we must fight."
JACK,"Slander and calumny! I have only ever embraced that oldest, noblest of all pirate traditions. My fellow mariners and shellbacks, I submit that here, now, that is what we all must do. We must fight to run away!"
JACK,"Ah, but Jones does have a body, doesn't he? Such as it is."
JACK,You made that up.
JACK,"""It be the duties of the King to declare war, parley with shared adversaries, co-ordinate forces ..."" Fancy that."
JACK,I call for a vote! Barbossa is dismayed.
JACK,Elizabeth Swann.
JACK,"Ah. Am I to understand, then, that we will not keep to code? SPLANG! One of Teague's mandolin strings breaks. Jack knows Teague's got his back on this. The lords exchange glances."
JACK,And where did that honest streak end me up? Dead.
JACK,"Mr. Gibbs. You've a ship to ready for battle, don't you? Gibbs is taken aback. Fine, if that's how he wants it:"
JACK,"What? You've seen it all. And survived. That's the trick, isn't it? To survive."
JACK,Parlay? 623
JACK,Me? My hands are clean in this. Figuratively.
JACK,There! Listen to the tool.
JACK,Even if that was my plan -- and I'm not admitting to anything -- there's not a tinker's chance of it coming off anymore.  Is there?
JACK,That debt was paid.  With some help.
JACK,Not done.
JACK,"Elizabeth, love, you're condemning me. Again."
JACK,"As you command, your nibs. He starts to cross to Beckett -- Barbossa grabs Jack's shoulder and whirls him around even as he draws his sword."
JACK,"First to the finish, then. Will and Jack complete the cross. Jones shoves Jack down."
JACK,You have no idea.
JACK,Poppycock?
JACK,I've never even thought 'poppycock.'
JACK,"I did not -- All three suddenly clutch their heads and yell in pain. They look over at Wyvern Jack -- he's got his BRAIN in his HAND. He squeezes it again; again, all three clutch their heads and yell in pain."
JACK,Stop it! Stop! You're giving me a terrible headache -- And that reminds him of something: JACK  The whelp.
JACK,-- Think like the whelp Think like the whelp Think like the whelp --
JACK,"Wish us luck, boys. We might need it. He moves past the bars. The Jacks watch him go."
JACK,"Good one.  I just came to see my effects.  Admirable though it is, why are you here when you could be somewhere else?"
JACK,"(looking for an escape route) To my great regret.  But it's never too late, he? Jack sheathes his sword, tips his hat -- JACK  And now, anon, adieu. Grabs a sail, loosens the bottom tie. The sail, partially free, fills with wind, and carries Jack to the upper rigging. 654"
JACK,"I can set you free, Jones."
JACK,"I already have the key. For a moment, Jones almost believes him, but then smiles, display the key at the end of a tentacle."
JACK,"Oh, that key. With his half sword, Jack slices at Jones' tentacles. BLACK INK sprays everywhere. The key falls -- -- lands on the deck of the Dutchman amid the splatter. Still clutched by a writhing tentacle fragment. Livid, Jones shoves Jack backwards -- Jack slashes down -- his sword is STOPPED by Jones' claw. Jones squeezes and Jack's sword is snapped in half. 658"
JACK,"Hullo, that's mine! Jack grabs the pistol from the Crewman as he head-butts him off the line. Jack comes swinging back around behind Jones, FIRES the pistol --"
JACK,"(he lets out a whimper at the sword) Jack looks, pulls a  bayline pin out of the capstan, uses that to block Jones' attack -- Jack dodges, keeping the capstan between them. Jones goes straight through the capstan -- Jack spins the capstan, turning Jones around to come out the other side -- As Will battles Bootstrap, giving ground -- 667"
JACK,"Do you? Jack stands with the chest open, and Jones still-beating heart in his hand. He squeezes it -- and Jones staggers, clutches at his chest. Jack smiles. He's got it all under control. Finally. Jones regains his balance ... takes stock of the situation. JACK  It's a heady tonic ... (tosses the heart in his hand) ... holding life and death in the palm of your hand."
JACK,"Self-serving and dishonest I'll give you, but cruel is a matter of perspective, is it not?"
JACK,"I've never been one for tradition. 677 ON THE ENDEAVOUR, Beckett stands at the helm, with the Armada re- 677 forming behind him. 678 ON THE PEARL, Jack moves toward the wheel, shouts orders: 678"
JACK,Close haul her! Luff the sails and lay her in irons!
JACK,Belay that belay that!
JACK,"Reasonable. 681 ON THE ENDEAVOUR, as Beckett sails in for the kill -- 681*"
JACK,Full canvas!
JACK,
JACK,"I've never seen a retreat from the other side before. Gibbs, you may fling my hat. Gibbs takes Jack's hat and throws it up into the air -- 694"
JACK,You keep telling yourself that.
JACK,Every king needs a queen.
JACK,"Granted, it tends to list to port, and has been known on occasion to frighten young women, but I promise, you will not be disappointed."
JACK,"Please, love. That is a dingy. My vessel is magnificent and fierce and huge-ish and ... gone. Why is it gone? Giselle spots the Black Pearl, far out to sea."
JACK,"Yes, there. There it is. Why is it there?  It's much larger up close."
JACK,Mr. Gibbs. Is there any particular reason my ship is gone?
JACK,"Girls! Will you PLEASE! Shut it! The ladies freeze, mid-motion tugging each other's hair. JACK  Listen to me. Yes, I lied to you, no, I don't love you, of course it makes you look fat, I have never been to Brussels, it is pronounced ""egregious,"" no, I haven't met Pizarro but I love his pies, and all of this pales to insignificance in light of the fact that my ship is gone! Savvy? SLAP! Jack's head is snapped to the side. SLAP! Back the other way. The girls storm off. Gibbs looks at Jack."
JACK,Give nothing back. It is a farewell. Gibbs heads off after the ladies.
JACK,"... we're devils and black sheep, really bad eggs ... Drink up me hearties, yo ho ... And so Jack Sparrow leaves us the way he arrived, alone, on a small boat, sailing into the sunset -- 700"
JACK,"All this -- for me? Jack gestures for everyone to sit, sit, sit, please sit, as he takes his seat. JACK  * All right, what do we have here? *"
JACK,Fft fft fft -- not necessary.  You were * saying?
JACK,Is that so? It says Jack Sparrow here.
JACK,I think that would be a poor defense. Unless you want to be bludgeoned like a harp seal.  The prisoner claims to be innocent of being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?
JACK,Foreman! Your finding! Guilty?
JACK,"Yes? The crowd screams for blood. Hang ‘em, string ‘em up. *"
JACK,"Shut it! You have been found guilty, and * so are sentenced to hang by the tongue until dead.  * Neck. I meant to say, neck. The courtroom STOMPS and CHEERS. Jack listens -- * JACK  What say ye? What? What is that?  You wish me to spare this wretched man’s * life? * No, they don’t want that! ""Kill him!"" ""Hang the scum!"" Etc. * JACK  * Give the people what they want. * POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       5."
JACK,"Not to worry. I’ve paid off the driver.  In ten minutes we'll be outside of Londontown, horses waiting. Tonight we make the coast. Then it's just a matter of finding a ship. Jack opens his coat, produces a flask. Gibbs’ mood brightens."
JACK,"What happened, Gibbs? I thought you had another gig."
JACK,Am not.
JACK,Am not.
JACK,"Truth is, Jack Sparrow arrived in town just this morning to rescue one Joshmamee Gibbs from one appointment with the gallows. You're alive, so there's a start."
JACK,"So. There’s another Jack Sparrow out there, sullying my good name."
JACK,"Aye. But, an imposter with a ship."
JACK,"That could be our ticket. Jack corks the flask, puts it back in his jacket. Gibbs notices the rolled-up map to the Fountain of Youth."
JACK," Circumstances arose, ensued, and forced a compelling insight regarding discretion and valor --"
JACK,"So untrue! I am just as bent as ever, hellishly so. I’ll taste those waters, Gibbs, mark my words --"
JACK,"And I’ll not have it said, there’s a point on the map Captain Sparrow never found -- The carriage stops. Jack frowns, pockets the map. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       8."
JACK,No.
JACK,There should be a Captain in there somewhere.
JACK,"The face, mmm, familiar ..."
JACK,Doesn’t ring a bell.
JACK,Vicious rumor. Not true.
JACK,"It may be true that that’s what you were told, but it’s nonetheless false that I have come to London to procure a crew."
JACK,"No, I am Jack Sparrow, but it’s not true that Jack Sparrow has come to London to procure a crew."
JACK,"No, no. I am Jack Sparrow. And I am in London. But I am not here to procure a crew. That’s someone else."
JACK,"Wait! I am Jack Sparrow, the one and only. And I am in London."
JACK,What? Jack’s rattling gets even louder. George waves a hand.
JACK,"How much do you weigh? The Guard just sneers at him. He pulls away the chains. Jack stands. Picks up a napkin, dabs his face. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       11. CONTINUED:  14 14"
JACK,No.
JACK,The truth? I lost it. Quite recently in fact.
JACK,Absolutely. Yes!
JACK,"With your permission? POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       12. CONTINUED:  14 14 Jack drags a heavy chair scra-a-a-ping across the floor, next to the table. Positions it just so. Sits, puts his feet up. JACK  You’ll be providing, then, a ship and a crew?"
JACK,Hector. Good to see a fellow pirate make something of himself.
JACK,As may be. But first. What became of the Pearl?
JACK,Lost? POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       13. CONTINUED:  14 14
JACK,"If that ship be lost, properly, you should be lost with it."
JACK,"You, sir, have stooped."
JACK,"But, Hector ... the wig. Suddenly, Jack slams the Guards together, shoves their rifles upwards; they both FIRE -- -- bullets hit the chandelier, a rope SNAPS; one side drops, sending the chandelier SWINGING. Jack leaps onto the table, races along, knocking away food -- POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       13A-14. CONTINUED:  14 14 -- reaches down, picks up the chair  and FLINGS IT AHEAD into the stained glass window -- They are on the second floor, it’s a long way down. Jack grabs the ropes to the curtains, just as the Tall Guard comes barreling his way -- -- the Tall Guard slips on the napkin  -- Out of control, the Tall Guard flails out the window. Jack politely hands the curtain ropes to him as he passes by. The Tall Guard plummets down. Jack, hanging onto the other rope, RISES UP just ahead -- -- of the slashing sword blade of the Captain of the Guards -- From the valance, Jack leaps for the chandelier (catching it just as it swings towards him) -- -- and Jack swings from the chandelier to the high balcony.  He pauses, raises a hand -- along the way, Jack has recovered the creme puff. He bites, chews, swallows, and is gone."
JACK,"If enough people keep saying it, it must be true. Teague notices a new dangle in Jack’s hair."
JACK,Broke it. Swallowed it. Sifted it. Retrieved it. Polished it.  Fashion.
JACK,You’ve been there.
JACK,Depends on the light.
JACK,On the map. There was a Chalice --
JACK,For?
JACK,Set sail? Love to. For that I’d need a ship.
JACK,I hear you be recruiting a crew.
JACK,Don’t you know who I am?
JACK,"You’ve stolen me and I’m here to take myself back. The two Jacks hide behind a post, peek out at each other. The two Jacks leap forward at the same instant, with exactly the same slashing attack. Swords CLASH; the pair are completely evenly matched. The two leap onto the hearth, face off.  When Jack moves, Other Jack does too. JACK  Stop doing that! Jack dodges, rolls expertly onto a crate. The other Jack executes the exact same roll. Jack tosses his sword back and forth between right and left hand. Other Jack does so too. The pair fight up a ramp. Other Jack rolls barrels down. Jack evades -- IN THE RAFTERS, Other Jack spins, ready -- But no one is there. Other Jack searches, looks down through the rafters -- nothing. Suddenly, a set of hanging barrels PLUMMET down. Other Jack springs back. Thinks, spins, raises a sword as Jack rises up behind, pulled up by the rope that holds the barrels -- -- their swords clash -- ON THE RAFTERS, they battle. Other Jack swings a pulley at Jack - - Jack grabs it, the pulley breaks, Jack lands on a stack of barrels. Other Jack leaps down, fights as barrels roll out from beneath them. A flash of intricate swordplay -- JACK  Only one person alive knows that move. Suddenly -- shockingly! -- Jack leans forward and KISSES Jack. Full on. A good kiss. Jack pulls back -- POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       19. CONTINUED:  24 24 JACK  So that’s what that’s like. Other Jack is smiling, eyes closed, enjoying the aftermath of the kiss. JACK  Hello, Angelica. Jack pulls away her fake beard."
JACK,I am touched at this most sincerest form of flattery. But why? Jack uses his sword to flip away her hat.
JACK,That is not a compliment.
JACK,"For leaving you? Jack rips open her bodice, revealing a very womanly figure."
JACK,A gentleman allows a lady to maintain her fictions.
JACK,"There is one pecadilly up with which I will not put. I will be impersonated as Captain, nothing less."
JACK,I could use a ship. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       20. CONTINUED:  25 25
JACK,There be a lot of hear-telling going on these days.
JACK,"Angelica, don’t fret, you've still a few usable years left."
JACK,"Ah. Regarding the Fountain. Waste of time, really. Unless we have -- AT THE DOOR, Scrum appears. He glances back out into the pub,"
JACK,I may have unintentionally slighted some King or other.
JACK,"Implying the need? There is a SLAM! at the door. Scrum locks it, puts his weight on it."
JACK,You demonstrated a lot of technique for someone I supposedly corrupted. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       21. CONTINUED:  25 25
JACK,Mistook it for a brothel. Honest mistake. The doors burst open. GUARDS swarm in -- POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       22.
JACK,"We? Speak again. Unlike some who purport to be but cannot in fact hold a candle to, I, am Captain Jack Sparrow. Jack leaps forward, stabs another barrel, sending more ale gushing. He takes a quick drink -- Angelica guards his back -- Jack and Angelica reach a trap door."
JACK,"Requires dangerous remedy. Jack grabs a rope, eyes the ceiling, slashes another rope nearby, ready to fly upwards -- Jack’s rope slithers to the ground. Angelica slashes a lever; the trapdoor OPENS and they drop -- POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       23. CONTINUED: "
JACK,How can you say I used you?
JACK,"I know, but how can you say it? They collapse onto the wet stones, catch their breaths."
JACK,What is what?
JACK,You wouldn’t happen to have two silver chalices? Circa Ponce de Leon?
JACK,I thought not.
JACK,"I hear stories, rumors. You are of course aware of the ritual. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       24."
JACK,And it requires ... what? Suddenly Jack flinches. He sports a VOODOO DART in his neck. He plucks it out.
JACK,"Zombie. The world gets woozy. Jack staggers, points a finger -- JACK  You have frozen eyeballs. And BLACKS OUT. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       24aA."
JACK,"Aye, sir! Jack rolls out of his hammock, is handed a mop --"
JACK,Um. There's been a mistake.
JACK,I’m not supposed to be here. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       26. CONTINUED:  31 31
JACK,"No. You see, I am Captain Jack Sparrow. The original."
JACK,Where am I?
JACK,There’s a glass coffin.
JACK,Scrum. Why is there a glass coffin?
JACK,Where am I?
JACK,Blackbeard.
JACK,"That fellow seems odd. French, is my guess."
JACK,"And perpetually ill-tempered. Jack smiles at Gunner, who sneers --"
JACK,"Five days underway, at least ..."
JACK,"The smell of the crew. Jack glances up, notices something. Squints. JACK  What did that fellow do, and how can I make sure to not? Jack gestures, Scrum looks -- BENEATH THE CROW’S NEST, a PRISONER is lashed to the mast, hands tied behind his back. A young man, dressed in a frayed cape. This is PHILIP SWIFT."
JACK,A man of the cloth -- on this ship? POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       29.
JACK,"No, odd is standing mid-ships back there with a whip."
JACK,Her. Our First Mate is a her.
JACK,"You are a ruthless, soulless crossgrained cur."
JACK,No. Blackbeard has a ship. Upon which I am now imprisoned.
JACK,Blackbeard. Edward Teach. The pirate all pirates fear. Resurrector of the dead in his spare time.
JACK,He listens to no one.
JACK,"Daughter, as in, beget by?"
JACK,He bought that.
JACK,"Then it’s the Fountain of Youth for him, or him and you, not you and I."
JACK,You’ll be handling that part yourself?
JACK,I’ve seen a thing or two.
JACK,"I can do that too, if you don’t count women, weather, and ... other things that are hard to predict."
JACK,You believe that?
JACK,Not much to hang your hat on.
JACK,Interesting.
JACK,"Tonight. Salaman nods, passes the word to a wizened pirate, EZEKIEL --"
JACK,"The topic is mutiny, gentlemen. Mutiny most foul."
JACK,"On to it, then. Blackbeard. What are his habits?"
JACK,"Yes. But, when he comes out? He must come out sometime.  Any of you sailed with him before? The Pirates glance at each other. No takers. JACK  Stays to his cabin. No one's sailed with him. No one's seen him. Good news, gentlemen. This is not Blackbeard’s ship. This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge."
JACK,How do you know? POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       35.
JACK,"Right, then. Gentlemen, a man’s first duty is less to his office than his own honor, and that he cannot perform if deceived."
JACK,"Aye. Ye’ve nay be informed of our destination. Death lies before us. We sail for the Fountain of Youth.  It be a sorry plight, mates."
JACK,Unless ... we take the ship.
JACK,"We take the ship, then. Now!"
JACK,Quick now!
JACK,It’s a dream. Angelica hears sounds of fighting.
JACK,"We’re taking the ship. Fair warning. You might want to -- With a SCREAM and a series of curses, Angelica leaps out of bed, sword in hand --"
JACK,"... stay out of it. The sword is pulled back; Jack turns just in time, taking up the attack of the Gunner, coming at him --"
JACK,He’s religious. I believe it’s required. Shouts from below --
JACK,"Fight! To the bitter end, you cack- handed deck apes! Angelica joins the Zombies, takes on three pirates, defending herself expertly. Jack outduels the Quartermaster, drives him to his knees. Pirates swoop in behind, lash him to a mast -- JACK  Take 'em, men. Tie 'em down tight! The crew have the numbers, and the advantage. Officers are overwhelmed, fighting two, three against one -- JACK  The ship is ours! Jack thrusts his sword in the air. The pirates do not join him; instead, they stare with horror -- Behind Jack, silhouetted against the moonlight, a nightmare of a man. Wrapped in bandoliers, draped in pistols, surrounded by smoke from fuses twined into his black beard. A hand hangs to his side, grasping a bottle of whisky. Edward Teach. BLACKBEARD. Jack turns as Blackbeard raises the whisky bottle, drains it in one long swallow. JACK  Ah. Blackbeard tosses the bottle away."
JACK,Captain. Sir. I am here to report a mutiny. I can name fingers and point names --
JACK,"Have I told you, sir, what a lovely daughter you have?"
JACK,Me. I stood watch. Sir. Blackbeard laughs. Looks to Gunner --
JACK,"I’ve no interest in the Fountain, so if your heart’s set, just drop me off anywhere."
JACK,"And you? The mighty Blackbeard. Beheaded, they say, and still you swam three times around your ship, then climbed back on board.  Yet here you are, running scared --"
JACK,To the Fountain. Blackbeard approaches Jack.
JACK,You have a high regard for fate.
JACK,I'm skeptical of predicting any future which includes me.
JACK,The mutiny served me well. I gained an audience with you.
JACK,"To warn you. Regarding your First Mate, who pretends to be persons she is not."
JACK,"She is not your daughter. What she is, is evil. More to be feared than a wild beast. Hungry wild beast. From hell. (ticks off the list on his fingers) Vengeful, hungry, from hell. Beast. And wild."
JACK,"Sir. The woman is consummate in the art of deception. OUTSIDE, near the door, Angelica stops, listens in on the conversation. BACK INSIDE -- POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       45."
JACK,But it was so easy.
JACK,Darling! Angelica steps into the room --
JACK,"I’ll have a look-see at those charts, straight away, if you don’t mind."
JACK,"Hola. Come. A drink. Jack tosses a glass to Angelica, nods to Scrum, who plays a Spanish tune on his mandola."
JACK,"Yes. Winding, twisting, turning, and writhing. Do you recall Saint Dominique?"
JACK,Either or. He pours her glass.
JACK,Was I the first? I wondered.
JACK,"This dance, m’lady. Jack times his request with the roll of the deck; off balance, she ends up in his arms. ANGLE: the Queen Anne's Revenge beneath the moon, anchored in a rolling sea, two figures dance on the swaying deck. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       49. Jack spins Angelica back into the rigging, with the SWAY of the ship he falls into her arms, as if she pulled him. JACK  Here? With your father on board? We’ll have to be very quiet."
JACK,"The truth? You’re going to get yourself killed, and I’m not inclined to stand by and watch."
JACK,"Blackbeard has served his purpose. Land is within reach. You and I can flee, go on to the Fountain together. There’ll be fame enough to share."
JACK,The profane ritual. The SWAY of the ship takes them out of the rigging. Jack turns it into an elegant spin.
JACK,Coincidentally.
JACK,"When once a liar speaks the truth, he yearns for trust so. Jack grabs a line. Gets a running start, swings off, into the night. Then swoops in behind her, drops lightly to the deck. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       50."
JACK,Ah. And?
JACK, Tell me the rules.
JACK,"We are thick as thieves. Angelica. He slips the ring onto her finger. In return, she whispers:"
JACK,Yes.
JACK,I find my desire for the Fountain greatly lessened.
JACK,So true.
JACK,Blackbeard?
JACK,"The Black Pearl. In a bottle. My ship is in a bottle. INSIDE THE BOTTLE, on the deck of the Black Pearl, Jack’s face 83 83 looms as large as a thundercloud. JACK THE MONKEY climbs up the rigging on the otherwise empty ship -- Suddenly the monkey's face LOOMS LARGE, DISTORTED BY THE GLASS -- 84 84 he SCREECHES -- Jack jumps back. 85 85"
JACK,He’s even more annoying in miniature.
JACK,Angelica -- I know you. You are not going to steal the life of some innocent man.
JACK,You’ve fallen for your own con.
JACK,"You lied to me, by telling the truth."
JACK,That's good. May I use that?
JACK,"You'll not give up this quest, then."
JACK,"Angelica, your father ... Blackbeard. He is evil and he will kill you, given the chance. He cannot be saved."
JACK,Or because I want you to believe that it works?
JACK,And you smell nice. But that’s beside the point. Jack is jerked forward as she drifts the doll to her bosom.
JACK," I want you. Next question? Jack comes close; his fingers entwine hers, surreptitiously grasping the doll ... he leans in to her waiting lips -- there is a sudden CLANG of the SHIP’S BELL -- QUARTERMASTER   Whitecap Bay!"
JACK,"We require a mermaid's tear. So, we require a mermaid."
JACK,You ever seen a mermaid? You start with a shark. Give them weapons. And make them all women. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       55. CONTINUED:  85 85
JACK,Did you miss the part about the sharks?
JACK,"Is that story still out there? A mermaid’s favor, perhaps, that sounds more like it."
JACK,How so? POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       56.
JACK,"Retreat, all! To land! For your lives! POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       62aA. Jack looks out. Everywhere Pirates battle the Mermaids, but the Pirates are losing -- and out in the bay, the water churns, a new wave of mermaids approaching. Pirates retreat onto land. Suddenly a line of SEAWEED shoots in 111 111 from the dark like a whip, wrapping around the pirate, pulling him away --"
JACK,"Please, don’t -- -- and SLAPS Jack, hard, his head spinning, water flying off his dreads. The Mermaid takes off with the others -- ELSEWHERE, Angelica pulls Blackbeard to his feet. Suddenly, a 120 120 commotion on shore:"
JACK,Did everyone see that? Cause I’m not doing it twice. Blackbeard glares at Jack.
JACK,Was that necessary?
JACK,"What I want first is Ponce de Leon’s ship. ON THE COMPASS, as it MOVES, ADJUSTS to a different direction. Jack snaps it closed, sets forth --"
JACK,"Now, what is the ritual again? Water from the Fountain, and a mermaid’s tear - - POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       67."
JACK,"So, one with a tear -- and water in both? These things can get complicated."
JACK,"How many years? A rather larger snake swims near. Jack jumps behind Angelica. Angelica grabs it, wields it at Jack."
JACK,"Run it by me again? Slowly? You need two Chalices -- Angelica, exasperated, curses at Jack in Spanish as she walks away --"
JACK,"Clergyman. On the off chance this does not go well for me, I want it noted that I will believe in whatever I must to get into heaven."
JACK,"No, no. I was thinking more of ... on an as-needed basis. Philip doesn’t answer; he has spotted a problem with Syrena, starts to move away -- Philip moves close to the glass. Syrena rises up, and transforms 130 130 to her half-human state. Her eyes, full of reproach, meet his. Philip notes: the glass cover is sealed, and chained closed. He glances back down. Looks closely. Syrena's skin is pale. Her eyes flutter. Breathing labored."
JACK,"I support the missionary’s position. The Quartermaster laughs. Philip takes the opportunity to grab the Quartermaster’s sword, wedges up the cover, breaking the seal. Syrena goes to the crack, breathes the air hungrily."
JACK,"As I thought. Not this way -- Too late. Angelica notes what Jack has seen: the remains of a bridge, pylons on each side, rope hanging."
JACK,We can go around. To the east. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       69.
JACK,"Aye, well, then we circle back. Angelica glances at the Quartermaster, who shakes his head."
JACK,"Well, you insisted on bringing a mermaid --"
JACK,You walk like a girl --
JACK,You mean jump?  This I cannot wait to see. Blackbeard turns to Jack.
JACK,What makes you think he will come back?
JACK,She’ll go.
JACK,"A day’s march north, following that river, until you reach a series of pools. Then you’re close. Blackbeard plucks the Compass out of Jack’s hand. Jack reaches for it, thinks the better of it."
JACK,"You know that feeling you get, sometimes, standing in a high place, a sudden urge to jump? I’m not feeling that. Blackbeard pulls one of his pistols, aims it a Jack."
JACK,Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall. Blackbeard considers ... moves his pistol over to Angelica.
JACK,You would not kill your own daughter.
JACK,"Please. None of them are loaded -- POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       71A. CONTINUED:  131 131 Jack picks one of the pistols, points it a tree, pulls the trigger -- it FIRES. Jack is shocked. JACK  If you’re so willing to kill her, let her jump."
JACK,You. If I jump. Will I survive? The Quartermaster stares at Jack a long time. He steps over to Angelica.
JACK,"Wet. Again. Again. ABOVE, on chasm edge, Angelica turns to Blackbeard. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       72. CONTINUED:  131 131"
JACK,"The Santiago. Famously captained by Ponce de Leon. Jack nods, then realizes nobody is there. JACK  Right, then. Jack climbs upwards --"
JACK,"Ponce de Leon. BARBOSSA  If forty pirates dreamt forty nights of treasure, it wouldn’t match the contents of this room. Jack whirls, sword in one hand, torch in the other. Out of the shadows steps Barbossa, sword drawn."
JACK,You.
JACK,"No, you."
JACK,Blackbeard sent me. You? POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       80. CONTINUED:  139 139
JACK,"Right, then. So we each choose an item of approximately equal weight, then -- Jack reaches for a stack of coins --"
JACK,"Ruddy hell. I’ll have it. Jack grabs the treasure, the ship overbalances --"
JACK,What about that?
JACK,"Hey! Jack takes a step back to counter. Barbossa steps back again, and the chest comes all the way to him. JACK  Why do you get to look first? POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       81."
JACK,"Empty. One can see where the Chalices would fit. Jack lifts up: two stones, set inside."
JACK,"They’re ahead of us, mate. Jack drops the stones back into the chest. JACK  I’ll have a look at that map. If it’s what I fear ... Jack and Barbossa move to either side of the bed, lean in, next to the skeleton."
JACK,"Aye. The Spanish know the path. I wonder why they left this behind -- Jack reaches for the map -- And the SKELETON HEAD TURNS, pointedly looking at Jack. Intensely creepy. Jack pulls his hand back ... and Ponce turns back to examining the map for all eternity."
JACK,"Gibbs! I was just on my way to come break you out of jail!  You stole my map. Gibbs shrugs; ‘yeah, true’; Barbossa stands."
JACK,There's a girl.
JACK,I should say ... a damsel.
JACK,Aye.
JACK,"Aye. It's just .... I may have ... done the lady some manner of harm, back in the day."
JACK,Gibbs. This is the woman from Seville.
JACK,"Worse. I may have had, briefly mind you ... stirrings."
JACK,Aye.
JACK,"No, not quite all the way to feelings. All right, feelings then, damn you!"
JACK,"Thank you. Suddenly Barbossa turns -- slashes a hand across his throat, telling them to be quiet. Points ahead, to -- In the distance, ruins of the long-ago fort, nearly covered by jungle. The Spanish have made camp. JACK  Stealth over force. I’ll take it from here, on account of your condition.  You don’t get termites, do you?"
JACK,Your sword smells funny.
JACK,"Point that thing the other way, will you? They reach the two palm trees. Barbossa stares, calculating. JACK  What are you doing?"
JACK,"(he never thought of that) Yes. Or. Sometimes, I just, improvise. They reach the ruins of a wall."
JACK,They’re beautiful. I’ve got to have them. Jack takes off --
JACK,"We stroll out. Slow and steady. Like you belong. Jack and Barbossa stroll, confident, like they have every reason to be there. Jack waves at a passing Spaniard, who goes by, does a double take -- draws his sword. Two other Spaniards join him; Jack and Barbossa working together, make quick work of them. Round a corner -- Find themselves face-to-face with three dozen Soldiers."
JACK,How’s that escape route working?
JACK,"Working on it. Might be able to get a hand loose ... Barbossa reaches forward awkwardly, hands still tied. Lifts his wooden leg, works hard to unscrew it. JACK  You’ve a knife. Good."
JACK,"I want one of those! Barbossa scoots the cup over to Jack. Jack gets a hand loose, drinks. Barbossa drinks from his wooden leg. JACK  Here’s to revenge, sweet and clear."
JACK,"Come clean with it, Hector. If you’d wanted the Chalices, you’d have seen they were missing and gone. You were lying in wait. For Blackbeard. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       88."
JACK,"King George, Privateer, the wig. Cheap theatrical facade. Not buying it. Barbossa bristles. Then --"
JACK,When the Pearl was lost.
JACK,Aye. As have I.
JACK,So. You’re not after the Fountain?
JACK,Not your right?
JACK,"I’ll see you get the chance. Using the rope wrapped around the tree as leverage, he schootches up the trunk, to a crouched position, then standing, then OUT OF FRAME. The Guards notice what is happening --"
JACK,"No need. Anyone care for a drink? Jack produces the two silver Chalices. Barbossa keeps moving, the others following --"
JACK,"Aye. Jack steps aside. Behind him, a good twenty feet away, Gibbs holds down a WILD BOAR, squealing and struggling. Tied to the back of the boar are the silver Chalices."
JACK,"Aye. Now, before I go just handing them over, I’ve one or two conditions."
JACK,"Firstly, I’ll be having my Compass back. No, that’s secondly. Firstly, upon your word, you will bring no harm to Angelica."
JACK,"Secondly, then, priorly firstly. I’ll be having my Compass back.  Come now. I deserve it. You have no idea how hard it was to catch that pig. Blackbeard nods. Angelica tosses Jack the Compass. JACK  Fine, then, and thirdly. Mister Teach more famously known as Blackbeard, you are not the only man in possession of a tattered soul. As I reflect on my misdeeds, chief among them, I note how poorly I have treated my loyal First Mate there, Mister Gibbs."
JACK,"Left him to rot in jail, I did, without a second thought or remorseful tingle. Point being, I’ll not subject him to the horrors to come. You’ll let him go free."
JACK,"Aye. Quick, or the pig runs. And good luck getting those Chalices."
JACK,"That'll lead you to freedom, 'mate. They exchange a look. Gibbs regards the Compass, as Blackbeard and Jack and the rest of the group move away."
JACK,"I swear, it was somewhere right around here. Jack steps forward, followed by Angelica, Blackbeard, Blackbeard’s entourage, and a bound Philip. CLOSE ON: a second frond is pushed aside; behind it is only Jack’s face. The frond is small. Jack examines it, notes a drop of water on its edge. He shakes the drop onto his hand -- The drop dances through Jack’s fingers, moving in and around, seeming at times to defy gravity, dripping upwards, and bending forward -- Jack follows the angle of the drop, looks THROUGH THE WATER DROP, and sees, carved in the rock wall, the precise archaic symbol that was on Ponce de Leon’s map and in the ship’s log book. When the drop flies upwards off Jack’s finger, the distortion is gone, and the symbol is gone as well. Beneath the rock wall is REVEALED: a cave entrance, darkness arching over deep still waters. Jack smiles. He knows he’s close."
JACK,Ah! Dead end. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       94A.
JACK,Yep.
JACK,"It’s not the destination so much as the journey, they say. The Chalices, if you please. Blackbeard indicates Jack be given the Chalices. The Quartermaster steps forward, pulls the Chalices from a pouch. He is protective of them, mistrustful, and reluctantly hands them over. Jack takes them, holds one in each hand, spreads his arms, then with a flourish, brings them together -- they CHIME. All wait. The chime FADES. Jack’s confident look falters. He CHIMES them again. Nothing. Angelica moves toward Jack, stalking him."
JACK,"You know, I never actually said that I had. Blackbeard cries out in anger, outrage. He pulls one of his pistols, FIRES at Jack -- -- in reflex, Jack raises a Chalice to his face; the bullet ricochets off. Jack gazes at the dent in wonder. Blackbeard aims another pistol -- Jack raises his hand. JACK  Wait. Jack stares at the Chalices. CLOSE ON: the inscribed words: ‘Aqua’ on one Chalice, and ‘de Vida’ on the other. JACK  Aqua de Vida. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       95. CONTINUED:  165 165 There is the immediate SOUND of water. All look, see ... along the sides of the cave, the odd sight of water RISING. Just a trickle at first -- POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       95A. CONTINUED:  165 165 More and more WATER appears, moving upwards. Rivulets turn to streams, collecting upwards into a pool above their heads. They stare, not sure what to do -- and then a bird flies into the cave, a colorful TOH with distinctive tail -- and INTO the rising water. The bird SHOOTS upwards -- JACK  Interesting."
JACK,"As I musted. Barbossa strides forward, speaking for all to hear --"
JACK,"Hold. Everyone actually stops. Jack is surprised, but goes with it. He counts each side, bobbing his finger. JACK  We look to be evenly matched. So you'll - -  -- fight against them --  -- and they'll --  -- fight against you. All on account of just him --  -- wanting to kill him.  Where's the sense? He looks at Scrum, who shrugs, he doesn't know. JACK  Exactly. I say let ‘em fight each other, while we lay back, watch, and place wagers. Aye? For a moment it seems they all might go for it. Then --"
JACK,Hand it over. The tear. There’s a good lad.
JACK,"Hah. Jack turns -- and Angelica is there, sword leveled. Two Chalices in her other hand. Beside him, Scrum pushes his sword into Jack’s neck."
JACK,"The Chalices, if you please."
JACK,What of the clergyman? You're wasting a perfectly good sap.
JACK,"You will need this, then.  And soon, by the looks of it. Angelica glances over, sees Barbossa fighting Blackbeard."
JACK,"Hah! Jack picks up Scrum’s sword, tosses it hilt first at Angelica. She has to throw the pouch to Scrum to catch the sword. Jack snags the pouch out of the air. Jack now has the pouch back, with his sword, and Scrum is standing there, holding the Chalices in each hand. Angelica has two swords. Jack kicks the Chalices away -- Angelica and Jack look at each other, dive for them --"
JACK,"Angelica, no -- Angelica pulls the sword out and lets it drop, her hands slashed and bleeding. JACK  No."
JACK,"No. You're not. Well, yes. But even so, you will be all right. Jack holds the two Chalices. Raises the right Chalice. JACK  Drink this. This one has the tear. Angelica considers the Chalice. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       104. CONTINUED:  179 179 JACK   You drink the other."
JACK,I cannot save you both! One of you must sacrifice for the other.
JACK,"Edward. She's dying. Save your daughter. Blackbeard takes one Chalice, then the other."
JACK,Aye. Hurry. Blackbeard turns to Angelica -- and quickly drinks the cup with the tear.
JACK,"Or ... wait ... was it the other way around? This cup had the tear, that cup - - hmmmn."
JACK,"He saved you. Maybe his soul is, now, redeemed. Angelica curses, raises the sword. Hears a sound. Looks -- Blackbeard’s body has already completely rotted away, like a 181 181 corpse many months under the water. His skin dissolves, leaving nothing but bones -- Jack looks, sees -- the Zombies, looking on, collapse, begin to decompose. The water around Blackbeard suddenly drops. Nothing is left, now, but a standing skeleton. And yet Blackbeard’s will is so strong, one last, sad, reach for her hand ... and then his BONES loosen and FALL, his skeleton joining the others, a few bones separating and clattering away. ANGELICA’s will is gone; she crumples to the ground."
JACK,The bloke who saved your life.
JACK,I only helped Blackbeard do what any father should have done.
JACK,"But fair, and fair is not the same as favorable. She looks past him, sees the small island ahead --"
JACK,A pistol. One shot.
JACK,This is a well-travelled trade route. You could signal a passing ship. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       109.
JACK,"You worked free of your bonds about a half hour ago, and you've been waiting for a chance to jump me ever since. Jack whirls back -- and Angelica is RIGHT THERE, her hands free, a piece of driftwood raised to club him."
JACK,"If you had a sister, and a dog ... I’d choose the dog. Jack pushes the boat to the water. Angelica drops the driftwood, wades out from the shore."
JACK,Funny. I don't recall that we --
JACK,There is not enough rum in the seven seas.
JACK,You're making that up. POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       110.
JACK,Oh?
JACK,"As do I. And so, as an act of reverence and ardor for us both -- Jack looks very pleased with himself -- JACK  We're through. Angelica expected a kiss, gets only empty air. Turns to see: Jack has pushed the longboat well out into the waves."
JACK,Missed!
JACK,"Gibbs, you ugly besotted shellback, you made it!"
JACK,And I trust we managed a profit from our joint enterprise? POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       111. CONTINUED:  191 191
JACK,"What of Blackbeard’s men, guarding the ship?"
JACK,"Shame indeed. Jack picks up the bottle. He holds it eye level, lining the Black Pearl up with the horizon --"
JACK,"We will need a crossbow, an hourglass, three goats, and one of us must learn to play the trumpet."
JACK,"There’s a start! LATER, ON THE BEACH, Gibbs stoops, hefts the sack, bottles 194 194 inside clanking. He looks like some Caribbean Santa Claus."
JACK,"The Fountain tests you, Gibbs. But ... not my style, play it safe. Better to not know which moment may be your last, alive to the mystery of it all -- and who’s to say I won’t live on? Jack Sparrow, finder of the Fountain of Youth. I’ve no choice, Gibbs -- Jack and Gibbs walk, their footsteps in the sand stretch on to forever, ahead a spectacular crimson Caribbean sunset. JACK  It’s a pirate’s life for me."
JACK,"It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide. 11. He starts up the dock, starpping on his sword belt; besides the scabbard, it also carries a compass, pistol and small powder horn. The Harbormaster cuts him off."
JACK,"What do you sat three shillings, and we forget the name? He tosses three shillings onto the ledger. The Harbormaster considers, then shuts the ledger on the coins, steps aside."
JACK,"Sorry, I didn't know. Music drifts down from Fort Charles. Jack looks up, shields his eyes. JACK  Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?"
JACK,This must be some important boat.
JACK,Ship.
JACK,"That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous."
JACK,"That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl? Mullroy scoffs at the name."
JACK,I'm sorry.  It's just such a pretty boat.  Ship. The sailors study him suspiciously.
JACK,Smith.
JACK,"None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating."
JACK,"Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth if he told you it. Murtogg and Mullroy consider that point --"
JACK,Aren't you going to save her?
JACK," Sailors. Above where Elizabeth struggles in the water, Norrington and several other men pick their way down the cliffs. They are too far away to get to her in time. Jack scowls. He has no choice -- and it pisses him off. JACK  Fine. He pulls a pistol from his sword belt, hands it to Murtogg; then hands the belt to Mullroy. JACK  Don't lose these. And then he dives into the water, swims toward Elizabeth. Elizabeth struggles to keep above water, gasping for air -- then a swell rolls over her, and she is submerged --"
JACK,"Move. He pushes past Mullroy, kneels over Elizabeth, raises the knife -- Murtogg is shocked -- Jack slits the corset down the middle, yanks it away. Elizabeth remains still. And then -- she coughs up water and gasps, choking on her first full breath. Jack is relieved."
JACK,"Clearly, you've never been to Singapore. Jack flips the knife and hands it hilt-first to Murtogg -- and that's when he spots -- The MEDALLION. Jack catches it up in his hand. JACK  Where did you get this? Before Elizabeth can answer, the BLADE of a SWORD is at Jack's THROAT -- Norrington's new ceremonial sword, in fact, looking bright and sharp."
JACK,Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please. Norrington looks out at the bay.
JACK,"Ah, but you have heard of me. Gillette returns with shackles, approaches Jack."
JACK,But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
JACK,"Finally. Lightning-quick, he snaps the corset around the hand and wrist of the man holding the pistol and yanks. The pistol sails into the water. Before anyone can react to that, Jack has the manacle chain wrapped around Elizabeth's throat. Pistols are drawn again, but now Elizabeth serves as a shield. Norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men. JACK  (backing away, toward land) Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and belt, please. Norrington hesitates, balls his fists in frustration. JACK  Commodore! Mullroy hands the pistol and belt to Norrington. Norrington holds them out to Jack. JACK  Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth? Elizabeth is more angry than frightened."
JACK,"Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind? 23. She takes the belt and pistol from Norrington -- Jack's quicker than she is, and takes the pistol from her. He jerks her around so she is facing him, belly to belly. JACK  Now, if you'll be very kind? She figures out what he wants: put the belt on him."
JACK,"I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square. Done. He turns her again, and then backs up until he bumps against the cargo gantry. JACK  Gentlemen ... m'lady ... you will always remember this as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow. He shoves Elizabeth away, grabs a rope and pulls free a belaying pin -- a counterweight drops and Jack is lifted up to the middle of the gantry, where he grabs a second rope -- Pistols fire -- and miss. Jack swings out, out, out, away from and around the gantry. Norrington has held his shot. With careful aim, he tracks Jack's trajectory -- Jack drops from the rope even as Norrington FIRES. His shot tears the rope -- -- as Jack plummets past one of the gantry's guy lines, he snaps the length of the manacle chain over the line and grabs hold of the far loop -- slides down the line -- -- drops to the deck of a ship. He runs, leaping to another ship, then out of sight --"
JACK,You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
JACK,"Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So if you'll excuse me ... 26. Beside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in the honing guide. Before Jack can react, Will has it in hand. JACK  Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?"
JACK,"Only a little. In responce, Will assumes an en garde position. Jack appraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing. Jack attacks. The two men stand in one place, trading feints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost impossible to follow. Will has no trouble matching Jack. JACK  You know what you're doing, I'll give you that ... Excellent form ... But how's your footwork?  If I step here -- He takes a step around an imaginary circle. Will steps the other way, maintaining his relationship with Jack. JACK  Very good!  And if I step again, you step again ... (continuing to step around the circle) And so we circle, circle, like dogs we circle ... They are now exactly opposite their initial positions. JACK  Ta! Jack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him. Will registers with angry surprise -- and then with a vicious overhand motion, he throws his sword -- -- the sword buries itself into the door, just above the latch, barely missing Jack. Jack registers it, then pulls on the latch, but it won't move up -- the sword is in the way. Jack rattles the latch. Tugs on the sword a few times -- it is really stuck in there. Jack mouths a curse, but when he turns back to Will, he's smiling. 27. JACK  That's a good trick.  Except, once again, you are between me and the way out. (points his sword at the back door) And now you have no weapon. Eyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from an anvil. Jack slumps in dismay -- but then he leaps forward. Will and Jack duel. Their blades flash and ring. Suddenly, Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at Will's head. Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed. Then Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarming him. Will quickly picks up another sword. Jack becomes aware that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords, knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion. JACK  Who makes all these?"
JACK,You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her? A direct hit -- and Will coils even more tightly with anger.
JACK,"(smiles; what did you expect?) Pirate. Jack steps forward. Will steps back, fully blocking the door. JACK  Move away."
JACK,Move!
JACK,"You're lucky, boy -- this shot's not meant for you. Jack uncocks the pistol. Will is surprised, reassesses Jack - - Suddenly, Mister Brown SLAMS his bottle against Jack's skull. Jack crumples to the ground. The front and back doors smash open, and SAILORS fill the room. Norrington pushes forward, sees Jack on the ground. 29."
JACK,"You can keep doing that forever, that dog's never going to move."
JACK,I know those guns! He peers out through the bars of the window. The other prisoners crowd around their window as well. JACK  It's the Black Pearl.
JACK,There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl.
JACK,"It's all right, doggie ... come here, boy.  Come here, Spot. Rover. Fido? To his surprise, the dog crawls out from under the bench. Jack continues to coax him closer. The key ring is nearly within Jack's reach -- suddenly, the dog's attention goes to the door into the cell block. He BRISTLES, GROWLS. He backs away from the door, whining. JACK  What's the matter, boy? The dog bolts, through the bars, into the cell, then out through the breached wall -- taking the keys with him. The door to the cell block bursts open. A pair of pirates step in: KOEHLER and TWIGG."
JACK,"Worry about your own fortunes.  The lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers ... and mutineers. Koehler and Twigg don't like hearing that. Koehler lashes out, grabs Jack by the throat through the bars. Jack clutches the pirates wrist, looks down -- Where they enter the moonlight, Koehler's wrists and hands are skeletol. Jack's eyes go wide -- he is holding a skeleton arm. JACK  You are cursed. Koehler sneers, shoves Jack bakwards, hard. Now out of the moonlight, his hand is normal. Jack stares, realizing -- JACK  The stories are true. Koehler ushers Twigg toward the door. Looks back."
JACK,Somewhat.
JACK,Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
JACK,Why ask me?
JACK,And you want to turn pirate yourself?
JACK," So it is that you found a girl. 47. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me. Will slams his fist against the bars in furstration. Jack is surprised at the outburst. Will thinks ... makes a decision."
JACK,How?  The key's run off.
JACK,You're name is Turner. Will gives him a puzzled look.
JACK,"Will Turner...  I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've changed my mind.  You spring me from this cell, and on pain of death, I'll take you to the Black Pearl.  Do we have an accord? Will gives him a suspicious look. The deal seems too good. Jack keeps his hand out, still smiling. Will shakes it."
JACK,"Agreed! Will looks around, figures out what he needs. He makes a chair his fulcrum, and levers the long bench under the door. Pushes down -- it's hard work -- but the cell door rises, and then falls forward, CRASHING down on the bench and chair. Jack is impressed. He steps out of the cell."
JACK,Not without my effects.
JACK,"My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?"
JACK,Good.
JACK,"No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us. Will steels himself, steps into the boat as if it's going to capsize with the slightest movement. Jack hoists the sail. JACK  Besides, we are about to better our prospects considerably. He nods toward the H.M.S. Dauntless, looming in the harbor. Will whiteknuckles the gunwales."
JACK,Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
JACK,"So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it. 50."
JACK,Remarkable how often those two traits coincide. The Jolly Mon nears the rudder of the much larger ship --
JACK,Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
JACK,Dead serious.
JACK,"We'll see about that. 51. More guffaws from the crew. A couple sailors more forward, hands on swords -- Gillette holds up a hand."
JACK,"Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound."
JACK,"As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!"
JACK,"A little help? Gillette shrugs, gestures to Murtogg and Mullroy. The three men throw their weight into the windlass, and it turns. Jack's pistol is on them the whole time."
JACK,"Lookee there, mate!  We're underway!"
JACK,Can you swim?  Can.  You.  Swim? Jack removes his hand.
JACK,"Good. Jack lifts the man up, throws him overbroad. Quickly unties the ropes to the grappling hooks. Will cranks the capstan bars, raising the foresail --"
JACK,"Thank you, Commodore, for getting our ship ready to make way! We'd've had a hard time of it by ourselves! Norrington seethes, but his order to Gillette is measured:"
JACK,"For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study."
JACK,Is that so?
JACK,"I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill."
JACK,"Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin."
JACK,"I swear, you look just like him."
JACK,Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
JACK," You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'"
JACK,Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
JACK,"Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again."
JACK,"Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it? 63. He kicks a lever on a wench. The sail boom whips around and slams Will in the chest -- sweeping him off the ship. His sword clatters onto the deck. Will dangles above the water. Jack slips a loop of rope around the wheel to hold the course. Picks up the sword -- and pokes at Will with it. Will hand- over-hands away from the blade, to the end of the boom. JACK  As long as you're just hanging there, pay attention.  Must, should, do, don't, shall, shall not -- those are just mere suggestions. There are only two absolute rules. (ticks them off on his fingers) What a man can do.  And what a man can't do. Will looks away, not interested. JACK  For instance: you can accept that your father was a pirate and still a good man ... or you can't.  Now me, I can sail this ship to Turga, by myself ...  But I can't just let you drown. Jack swings the boom back in. Will drops to the deck. Jack holds the hilt of the sword out. Will takes it. Glares at Jack, considers what he'll do next. Jack watches him coolly. Will turns and strides to his spot on the deck, sits down, and resumes sharpening his sword: shhhk -- shhhk -- shhhk ... Jack breathes a silent sigh of relief. Notices his shaking -- he takes the wheel."
JACK,Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
JACK,"We need a crew.  We can manage the ship between islands, but the open sea, that's another matter -- Suddenly the Redhead SLAPS Jack, hard. Satisfied, she turns and strides off. Will ignores her."
JACK," Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there! Jack leads Will toward the pub: the Faithful Bride, the emblem over the door a politically incorrect painting of a smiling woman holding a bouquet in her chained-and-manacled hands. Jack pulls open the door; Will goes inside passing a pretty ASIAN woman coming out -- she sees Jack and immediately SLAPS him, cursing something in Chinese. Jack backs away --"
JACK,"AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together -- She SLAPS him again. Will shakes his head, heads for the bar. Jack gets up. 65. JACK  Borrowed.  Borrowed your boat.  Without permission. AnaMaria charges; Jack backs away, puts a table between them. She chases him around the table, still carrying the tray."
JACK,Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
JACK,You'll get it back.  Or one better.
JACK,"Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition."
JACK,Just the one. Gibbs pauses. He takes a dainty sip.
JACK,First -- have you found me a crew? 67.
JACK,"Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea? Gibbs evades answering him by taking a long sip. Jack leans forward. Gibbs leans forward. JACK  I'm going after the Black Pearl. Gibbs straightens up like he's been hit. He stares. He reaches for the drink as if to down it -- but then sets it back down. He leans forward again. Jack has not moved."
JACK,"I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it."
JACK,"Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew."
JACK,Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
JACK,"Back there, guarding the door is the son of old Bootstrap Bill Turner. Gibbs' eyes widen over the edge of the tankard. Peers at Will. Then smiles, with more missing teeth than good ones."
JACK,That he is.
JACK,"Mr. Cotton.  Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true, in the face of danger, and almost certain death? Cotton lifts the parrot off his shoulder, raises it --"
JACK,"That goes for the rest of you! Danger and near certain death.  For we are to sail for the Isla de Muerta, to rescue the daughter of Governor Swann.  An equal share of the reward shall be-- Jack hears movement, looks back -- several potential crew members back away in fright; first one, then another, turn and run, followed by more. Soon just a half dozen are left, including Cotton (with parrot) -- and AnaMaria."
JACK,These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
JACK,"She can hold a bit longer. The wind picks up, howling. Jack smiles."
JACK," We're catching up! Jack turns back to the sea, enjoying himself. Gibbs stares at him like he's a crazy man."
JACK,"Bear three points starboard. AnaMaria turns the wheel, adjusting course. The ship leans into the new direction. Jack looks down -- 72. ON THE COMPASS -- where the indicator spins, reverses, settles on -- northeast. JACK  Six points port! AnaMaria frowns, but follows the order, turns the wheel back, and the ship responds. Will works on deck, coiling a rope -- but he watches Jack and AnaMaria, clearly not happy. Gibbs hobbles up."
JACK," I didn't! Will and Gibbs jump. Jack is right there beside them. JACK  My body's still there, rotting away, and I am but a ghost! Will and Gibbs aren't sure what to make of that. Jack laughs."
JACK,"Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold. He starts off."
JACK,"The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good. Jack lets this sink in. He pulls out the pistol, raises it. JACK  But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--"
JACK,"They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --"
JACK,Depends.
JACK,"On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not -- By now, the moving water tugs on the longboat, and they are sucked in -- JACK  -- well, too late. The boat rushes forward, plunges into darkness --"
JACK,"Chalk one up for the stories. Will leaps out into the water, pulls the boat ashore -- 77."
JACK,Me!
JACK,"No, I'm -- rescuing you. Elizabeth can't comprehend that one."
JACK,"This way! They race off, toward a bit of moonlight --"
JACK,"The trick isn't getting here, it's getting away. As if on cue, they hear the yells of pirates, coming closer. They take off --"
JACK,"No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on. Will and Elizabeth stare at him."
JACK,"I'll lead them away. The sounds are closer. JACK  Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy."
JACK,"I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little. Will nods, hesitates ... gives Jack his sword -- now Jack has two, one for each hand. Elizabeth gives him a quick kiss. Will and Elizabeth race away, and are gone. 82. Jack watches them a moment, turns to face the pirates. He sticks the two swords in the ground, crossed. Leans casually against a rock. A group of pirates round a corner, cutlasses drawn, ready to fight -- but Jack raises his hand. JACK  I invoke the right of parlay, according to the Code of the Brethren, set down down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew..."
JACK,"The woman's blood didn't work, did it? Barbossa hesitates. JACK  I know whose blood you need, to end the curse."
JACK,"No you won't. Barbossa nods. Pintel steps forward, puts a blade to Jack's throat. Jack's smile widen."
JACK,Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
JACK,"You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need. Barbossa stares at him, incredulous."
JACK,That's right.
JACK,"I'm a man of my word. The pirates laugh louder. JACK  You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice."
JACK,"You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do? Jack is still smiling, intentionally smug now. Barbossa sees his options dwindling, begins to pace."
JACK,Wait as long as you like.
JACK,Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
JACK,"And if I tell you the truth, you become, and you won't come near me because you know I'd kill you. Barbossa hesitates. The pirates are amazed at how the tide has turned; Barbossa has gone past considering the idea, and might even do it."
JACK,"See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want."
JACK,What -- you don't have the medallion?
JACK,I'll watch my back.
JACK,"Don't hit my ship!  I mean, kill the lying scoundrel --  I'm a little conflicted, here. Twigg just stares."
JACK,Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
JACK,"It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it."
JACK,"Someone needs to cut these bonds, then. Barbossa smiles, shows a pistol. Points it at Jack."
JACK,"The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot. The pirates mutter agreement."
JACK,"A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time. A pirate hands Jack's pistol to Barbossa."
JACK,You can go to your grave not knowing.
JACK,"That's the second time I've had to watch that man sail away with my ship. He turns away, and swims after Elizabeth."
JACK,The trees are taller. Jack checks to see if the pistol parts are dry; they are. He sets about re-assembling and loading his pistol.
JACK,Not yet.  Ask me again in a few weeks. Elizabeth can't believe it.
JACK,Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it. He climbs up toward a clump of palm trees. Digs for something beneath the sand. He finds it: a large iron ring.
JACK,"It won't.  It won't, and so we won't. He jumps down into the pit, cracks open a bottle of rum, takes a swig."
JACK,"Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that."
JACK,"Welcome to the Caribbean, love. He gathers up a few bottles, heads for the beach. 97. JACK  You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair."
JACK,"You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner. He drinks -- and difiantly returns Elizabeth's angry gaze. But then turns away, sits down. JACK  Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about."
JACK,"Try it.  It goes down rough, but it goes down -- and the second swig goes down easier. Elizabeth considers. Comes to a decision. She unseals the bottle, takes a swig. They sit in silence for a bit."
JACK,"What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please."
JACK,"I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it."
JACK,Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
JACK,"More to drink! He gathers two more bottles, tosses one to her. She drops her half-finished bottle to catch it. Opens it, takes a sip. JACK  Well? Elizabeth clears her throat, begins to sing self- consciously, becoming stronger as she goes on."
JACK,"I LOVE this song!  Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me!  We're beggars and blighters, ne'er do well cads, Drink up me hearties, yo ho! (gives it a touch of Irish ballad) Aye but we're loved by out mums and our dads.  Drink up me hearties, yo ho! They hoist their bottles, but only Jack drinks. He drains the bottle, then tosses it away. JACK  When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!"
JACK,"Not just the Spanish Main.  The whole ocean ... the whole world. Wherever we want to go, we go. 100. That's what a ship is, you know. Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails.  That's what a ship needs ... but what a ship is -- what the Black Pearl really is ... is freedom. Elizabeth lays her head on his shoulder."
JACK,"Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved."
JACK,"We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs. Elizabeth shrugs with a sleight -- but promising -- smile. She picks up the empty bottle from the ground, holds it up."
JACK,"To the Black Pearl. They tap the bottles together. Elizabeth feigns a drink as he chugs. He taps his bottle against hers again. She laughs, feigns another drink --"
JACK,"What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!"
JACK,Why?
JACK,"You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?"
JACK,They'll be no living with her after this.
JACK, We had time to get to know each other.
JACK,"Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?"
JACK,"Congratulations, sir. Crew men lead Jack toward the bridge. Sailors go about their tasks, and the ship begins its slow turn."
JACK,"Nor did you, I noticed."
JACK,Exactly.
JACK,"I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided."
JACK,"Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you."
JACK,They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
JACK, I knew you'd listen to reason!
JACK,"That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is."
JACK,"I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them. The crewmen release the lines, and the boat drops -- 108."
JACK,Do you have any idea where you're going?
JACK,Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
JACK,"It's the right way. Will joins him -- and sees what Jack is staring at: Treasure piled on treasure, sparkling, glowing, seemingly endless. At the center is the moonlit clearing, and the stone Aztec chest."
JACK,You don't want to be doing that. Barbossa pretends to think about his words.
JACK, All right then. That makes Barbossa pause. He steps out of the moonlight.
JACK,"Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor."
JACK,-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves. A buzz of apprehension sweeps through the pirates.
JACK,"You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal."
JACK,"Simple.  Don't kill the boy yet. Wait for a more opportune moment. Will glares, listening to every word he says. Jack scoops up a handful of coins from the chest. 112. JACK  (drops the coins one- by- one back into the chest) Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men."
JACK,The situation has changed.
JACK,"Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl? Jack smiles and spreads his hands: me. JACK  I sail for you as part of your fleet, I give you fifteen percent of my plunder, and you get to introduce yourself at tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore Barbossa.'  Do we have an accord? Barbossa licks his lips. It's tempting ... JACK  Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right? 113."
JACK,There's ... another exit?
JACK,"Oh, please -- did I really seem that clever? Before Will can answer, Jack smoothly slips the sword from a Pirate's scabbard -- tosses it to Will, who catches it despite his sursprise. JACK  Use it well. He draws his own sword -- and clobbers the Pirate. Barbossa and the other pirates stare in shock --"
JACK,"Remarkable how often those two traits coincide. Jack drives him back, making Barbossa laugh. 118."
JACK,"Well, isn't that interesting. Skeleton Jack pulls the sword from his chest. He pulls something from his pocket: one of the Aztec coins. JACK  They're so pretty, I just couldn't resist stealing one.  It's a curse, I guess. Barbossa grabs up his sword, and rushes Jack. Both men are in moonlight now, two skeletons in pitched battle."
JACK,"Or you could surrender. He shoves Barbossa back, out of the moonlight. Barbossa stalks the room, his attention focused on Jack."
JACK," The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate. Jack cuts his palm, grips the coin he stole above the chest ... and then hesitates. Will looks at him ... Jack releases the coin. It lands in the chest beside the other bloody coin. Suddenly, the lid of the chest, all on its own, SLAMS SHUT. Elizabeth stares at it."
JACK,Tough luck.  I was rooting for you.
JACK,"AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!"
JACK,"Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape! Gibbs actually stomps the deck, executes a salute. Jack stands at the wheel: he's got his ship back, and all is right with the world. He begins to unconsciously hum: ""Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me ..."" He realizes what he's doing and smiles, the orchestra takes over as the Black Pearl sails for uncharted waters ... and we FADE UP large words in script:"
